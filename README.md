# Comp3000
Comp3000 final year project, web based Health tracker with multiple points of data entry


Web-based application for adding data related to health, this data will be displayed on a timeline usign graphs to show progress, the application will then use this data and AI (Artificial Intelligence) to predict future improvement, this means the user will be able to see how their activity is having an effect on their weight/heart rate  allowing for the user to feel better motivated. 

This application would consist of: 

Webpages – general management page, data entry page, and reuse the lights system from comp 1003 

Database – store basic data about user on university database (like comp 2003)  

AI - uses basic AI to predict future health changes (utilize same principles as Comp2002). 

Android application for wear OS – basic data entry from user on the go (must connect and send data to website) 

 

Goal: 

Webpage 

AI predictions 

Data storing 

Android app that sends data to the webpage 

 

Possible issues: 

AI used on webpage (needs researching) 

Connecting the android app to the webpages or databases
